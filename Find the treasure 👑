We are in a room with three chests. We know that at least one has a treasure in it. Each chest has a message, but all the messages are lies.

Left chest: The middle chest has a treasure
Middle chest: All these chests have treasures in them
Right chest: Only one of these chests has treasures.

Which chests have treasures?


The middle chest does not have a treasure since the left chest is lying.
There is more than 1 treasure since the right chest is lying, so we have the left and right chests with treasures.
